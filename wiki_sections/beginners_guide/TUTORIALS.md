## Tutorials
*Contributors: Bivurnum and RavePossum*

There are a great many tutorials for the gen 3 decomps, and the list keeps growing with each passing day! The decomp that gets the most attention here is pokeemerald (and by association pokeemerald-expansion). However, if you're finding a lack of pokefirered tutorials, note that Emerald was based on FireRed and LeafGreen, so there is a lot of inherent compatibility between them. Also, there was somewhat of an active effort to align the pret repos for compatibility. So, a lot of what works for pokeemerald also works for pokefirered (occasionally with some minor code tweaking).

* [**The pokeemerald wiki**](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/wiki): There is a whole tutorials section here with contributions from countless hackers. The tutorials are organized by section, so it is easy to find the kind of tutorial you're looking for. Feel free to contribute to it if you come up with something new yourself.

* [Team Aqua's Asset Repo](https://github.com/Pawkkie/Team-Aquas-Asset-Repo): In addition to having its own sections of tutorials and feature branches, this entire repo is a collection of assets that have been made available to the whole rom hacking community. If you use any of these assets in your own projects, please be sure to give proper credit to the people who created them. And feel free to contribute to the repo with your own original assets or tutorials! They also have a [wiki](https://github.com/Pawkkie/Team-Aquas-Asset-Repo/wiki).

* [Team Aqua's Hideout Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLNv9Lq6kDmTIYfN5NvgQRvfOHTOXl0uU): Some of the videos are a bit outdated, but this playlist is still one of the best ways to get to know how the decomps work.

* [pokecommunity](https://www.pokecommunity.com/forums/decomp-disassembly-tutorials.475/): These forums contain tutorials for both disassemblies (gen 1 and 2) and decomps. This list is a little harder to sort through, and some of these tutorials are also represented in the pokeemerald wiki, but there are some very useful guides in here if you take the time to look for them.
