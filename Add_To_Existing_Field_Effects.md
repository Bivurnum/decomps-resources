# Adding Additional Field Effect Images/Palettes to Existing Field Effects

This brief guide shows how you could add new graphics to the existing field effects in order to change the images/palettes based on the criteria you set.
The field effect system is convoluted and hard to add to, so it is much easier to piggyback off of the existing code than it is to add an entirely new field effect.
A more comprehensive version of this guide will be added eventually.
